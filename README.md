CrowdStrike is actively working with affected customers regarding a defect detected in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts were not affected. This was not a cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated, and a solution has been implemented.


Details:

Symptoms include hosts experiencing a bugcheck or blue screen error related to the Falcon sensor. Windows hosts that have not been impacted do not require any action as the problematic channel file has been reverted. Windows hosts that are brought online after 0527 UTC will also not be impacted.

This issue is not affecting Mac- or Linux-based hosts.

Channel file "C-00000291*.sys" with a timestamp of 0527 UTC or later is the reverted (good) version. Channel file "C-00000291*.sys" with a timestamp of 0409 UTC is the problematic version.

Note: It is normal for multiple "C-00000291*.sys" files to be present in the CrowdStrike directory. As long as one of the files in the folder has a timestamp of 0527 UTC or later, that will be the active content.

It helps identify if an endpoint received a specific configuration file during an impacted time window and if it was online during that period.
